# Adanet Init

This is a helper program to initialize and calibrate an Adanet device. If using to calibrate, first update `CO2_AMBIENT` to the actual value (note that local COâ‚‚ concentration is often higher than global ambient levels, e.g. [during nighttime in cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749101002561?via%3Dihub).)
